# Ping-Pong-Ball-Levitation
PID based Ping Pong ball control levitation using Ni Myrio and labVIEW programming environment

In this project we are using a NI myrio microcontroller to build a control system 
which controls the location of the ping pong ball inside a acrylic tube. 

We have used a centrifugal fan as the levitating medium to contorl the ball and
to measure the distance of the ball using an Ultrasonic sensor.

We have attached two labVIEW FPGA based program for the ultrasonic sensor and the Fan which runs on the main VI and controlled by the PID VI.
