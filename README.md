# Ping-Pong-Ball-Levitation
PID based Ping Pong ball control levitation using Ni Myrio and labVIEW programming environment

In this project we are using a NI myrio microcontroller to build a control system 
which controls the location of the ping pong ball inside a acrylic tube. 

We have used a centrifugal fan as the levitating medium to contorl the ball and
to measure the distance of the ball we used a HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor.

We have attached two labVIEW VI for the ultrasonic sensor and the Fan which run on FPGA along with the complete project file for the mentioned system.
